The RP does not impact performance at the slightest.

Shows the animation, the utility, and how bad I am at PVP Games! (FPS Drops because of my recording software and because when I tab out the FPS decreases. The RP is performant and will not impact performance.)

## Configuration:
If you havent extracted the .zip yet, now is the best time to do so.

I recommend opening up a world and having this command ready in your clipboard: `/title @s title "Test Title"`

### Steps:
- Go inside the resource pack and locate `assets/minecraft/shaders/core/rendertype_text.vsh` then open it.
- Scroll down a bit and you will see a massive block of text that has "CONFIGURATION" on it.
- Simply read it and edit the values it has provided.
- Once you are done editing, do `F3+T` to reload the pack and run a title command like what I provided at the top and see if you like it. You can tweak it to your liking until you get the result you want.
